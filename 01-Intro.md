Goals today...

* Syllabus (course overview) & intros
* Intro to Observable
* Three Little Circles (Intro to HTML, SVG, CSS & D3)

## Syllabus

See Canvas

## Intros

* What brings you to CS 7290?
* Background -- CS, other disciplines, web technologies?
* What do you like to do outside of class?

## Projects

[projects.md](projects.md)

## Python perspective on web technologies

* [Data viz with web technologies](https://observablehq.com/d/6d370fb46c1bf74d)

## Intro to Observable

5-minute hands-on explorations that introduce Observable -- these are new.

* [First steps with Observable](https://observablehq.com/guide/first-steps)
* [Exploring Olympic athletes data](https://observablehq.com/guide/athletes)
  * Did you notice that you can dynamically inspect athletes?
* [Electricity use vs. temperature](https://observablehq.com/guide/electricity)

## Reactive notebooks

* The following excerpts come from this [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01174-w)
  * the article compares "reactive" notebooks -- higlighting Observable notebooks -- to Jupyter and friends
  * computational notebooks (e.g., Jupyter) -- combine code, results, text and images in a single document
  * down sides: can be confusing, foster poor coding practices, difficult to share and collaborate
  * "A 2019 study found that just 24% of 863,878 publicly available Jupyter notebooks on GitHub could be successfully re-executed, and only 4% produced the same results."
  * "Notebooks are messy. You write stuff, keep old crusty code behind, and it's hard to kind of figure out which cells to execute in the right order because you're trying different things.?
* version control is a challenge
  * it's hard to "diff" a Jupyter notebook -- they often have binary content, and content often changes when rerun
  * Colab has added some diff functionality to their jupyter in a container, which is an improvement

## Python perspective on Observable

* [Observable for Python users](https://observablehq.com/collection/@observablehq/observable-for-python-users)
  * [Learn just enough JavaScript](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/learn-just-enough-javascript-python-users?collection=@observablehq/observable-for-python-users)
  * [Observable for Jupyter users](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observable-for-jupyter-users?collection=@observablehq/observable-for-python-users)
  * [JavaScript replacements for Python data science tools](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/javascript-replacements-for-python-data-science-tools?collection=@observablehq/observable-for-python-users)
* [Observable for Jupyter users](https://observablehq.com/collection/@observablehq/observable-for-jupyter-users)
  * [observable-jupyter](https://github.com/thomasballinger/observable-jupyter) -- embedding JavaScript
* Other approaches
  * [robservable](https://juba.github.io/robservable/articles/introduction.html) -- embedding JavaScript
  * [observable-jupyter-widget](https://github.com/thomasballinger/observable-jupyter-widget) -- embedding + widgets
  * [reactor](https://github.com/herbps10/reactor) -- R -- highly experimental, reactive R cells
  * [plotly.com](https://plotly.com/) -- full-blown web server back end (R or Python) with JavaScript front end

## Tutorials

* [Tutorials](https://observablehq.com/tutorials) -- collection of collections
* [Learn just enough JavaScript](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/learn-javascript-introduction) -- of interest?

## Teams

* [Creating teams](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/team-creation-and-administration?collection=@observablehq/workspaces)
  * Add people with a username, or multiple mail addresses separated by commas

## Three Little Circles

* [America's Cup](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/25/sports/americas-cup-course.html) -- nytimes.com
  * A little motivation for SVG circles
