* Also offered options for students -- either pick something from me or bring your own project
  * observable-jupyter option
  * observable-juypyter-widget option
  * stinky: engage community in raising awareness for smell-my-city app
  * bioscience map: linked chart in a dashboard setting is what we need

## Dr. Aileen Huang-Saad

* She'll be visiting class at ~6:30 and should have T-shirts
* Be ready with questions for the bioscience map project

## Dr. Melanie Tory

* Has a class exercise on assessment of effective of dashboards.
* You can pick one of ours, or any other one of your choice.
* We'll use [this exercise](Class\ exercise.pdf) to help with completing our projects.
* Examples:
  * [Best states to retire](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sam.epley/viz/BestStatestoRetireintheUnitedStates/BestStatestoRetireintheUnitedStates) -- the example in the [exercise document](Class exercise.pdf)
  * The dashboard that Dr. Huang-Saad will be discussion
  * [AIDSVu map](https://map.aidsvu.org/map)
  * [Interactive Plot Dashboard](https://observablehq.com/@ambassadors/interactive-plot-dashboard)
  * Or any other interactive data visualzation/dashboard (must be interactive and publicly available)
* For the exercise, I'll give you access to a Google Sheet with a table of heuristics and questions.
  * You need to fill this out and give it back to me -- do NOT use your name!
  * I'll then give it to Melanie while maintaining your anonymity (important for her study).
