# 09-Dashboards

## Team project repos

* [stinky](https://github.com/cs7290/stinky)
* [bioscience](https://github.com/cs7290/bioscience)

## Projects ideas

Objectives for today: lay out project goals from an informational perspective -- for team and individual projects

* Notes last week: [../08-Prototypes/08-Prototypes.md](../08-Prototypes/08-Prototypes.md)
* Notes last week laid out 2 class projects (stinky & bioscience map)
* Also offered options for students -- either pick something from me or bring your own project
  * observable-jupyter option
  * observable-juypyter-widget option
  * stinky: engage community in raising awareness for smell-my-city app
  * bioscience map: linked chart in a dashboard setting is what we need

## Dr. Aileen Huang-Saad

* She'll be visiting class at ~6:30 and should have T-shirts
* Be ready with questions for the bioscience map project
* [facilities map](https://gmri.org/projects/facilities-resource-map)
* [jobsplan dashboard](https://maine.gov/jobsplan/dashboard)
* [https://biomaine.org/member-directory/)
  * Trade organization for biosciences in the state -- membership driven
  * Good for identifying a cohort of companies for plotting
* [EMSTAR](https://www.lifesciencesmaine.com/about)
  * Midcoast group -- beginning to organize things
  * Information underneath the names is more relevant for filtering, etc.
* [Aileen's site](https://teel.sites.northeastern.edu/life-sciences-in-maine/) in early stages
* Would like a GUI for intellectual capital rather than just brick and mortar (which is what's there now)
* Dataviz ideas
  * [Force-directed graph](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph?collection=@d3/d3-drag)
  * [Obama budget](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/13/us/politics/2013-budget-proposal-graphic.html)
  * [Divisibility network](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/divisibility-network)

## TODO -- bioscience (JN, JK, DM, AF)

* Force-directed graph -- with the data we got from Aileen
* Add another set of labels for the institutions (6-10 unique labels)
* Investigate transition between two set of graph visualizations
* Then connect it back to the dots on a map
* Put the data in Google Sheet connected to a notebook

## TODO -- stinky (NW, PM, AB, LH)

* Integrated compass map (P)
* Bootstrap messages (L)
* Clustering (A) -- get the story (TBD) associated with a blob
* How to contribute to this dataset (smell-my-city)
* Update fairly quickly with an API (how long will it take to update the map)

## Dr. Melanie Tory

* Has a [class exercise](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1kOMGuX7Rg97CRh73gozl80rqQXtvT_pm) on assessment of effective of dashboards.
* You can pick one of ours, or any other one of your choice.
* We'll use [this exercise](Class%20exercise.pdf) to help with completing our projects.
* Examples:
  * [Best states to retire](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sam.epley/viz/BestStatestoRetireintheUnitedStates/BestStatestoRetireintheUnitedStates) -- the example in the [exercise document](Class%20exercise.pdf)
  * The dashboard that Dr. Huang-Saad will be discussion
  * [AIDSVu map](https://map.aidsvu.org/map)
  * [Interactive Plot Dashboard](https://observablehq.com/@ambassadors/interactive-plot-dashboard)
  * Or any other interactive data visualzation/dashboard (must be interactive and publicly available)
* For the exercise, I'll give you access to a Google Sheet with a table of heuristics and questions.
  * You need to fill this out and give it back to me -- do NOT use your name!
  * I'll then give it to Melanie while maintaining your anonymity (important for her study).
